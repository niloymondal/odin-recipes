    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      This homemade pasta recipe is consistently great and easy to make with
      flour, eggs, salt, olive oil, and water. Roll out by hand or use a pasta
      machine to cut dough into desired pasta shape.

      Why buy the boxed stuff when you can make noodles at home? This homemade
      pasta recipe is way better than what you can buy at the store — and it’s
      surprisingly easy to throw together with just five ingredients you likely
      already have on hand!
    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul type="disk">
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
      <li>Whisk egg, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Add ground beef and bread crumbs; mix with your hands or a fork until
        well blended.
      </li>
      <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
      <li>
        Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per
        side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
        the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
